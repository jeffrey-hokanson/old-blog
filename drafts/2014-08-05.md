A warning to the wise: FlowJo has a "helpful" feature.
If it has already loaded a dataset, when you reload it, it doesn't actually reload the file.
It simply pulls the copy it has stored in memory.
So, when I was debugging an FCS writer, I couldn't find the source of my bugs, despite tweaking almost
every option.  
It turned out, FlowJo was not reloading the file
